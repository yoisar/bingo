## Simple Bingo
I develop it in 2007. This app was developed for the solidarity events of Rotary Club Posadas Oeste en Posadas, Misiones, Argentina.
 This app, simulates the lottery drum showing random numbers from 1 to 100. 
 It was developed using the Prado Framework (https://github.com/yoisar/prado)
